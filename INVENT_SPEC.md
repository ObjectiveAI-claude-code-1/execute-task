Evaluate and rank code snippets based on their structural clarity. Structural clarity means how effectively each snippet reveals its execution path and logical flow, making it immediately obvious how the code works from input to output. Assess each snippet for the straightforwardness of its control flow, whether it follows recognizable and conventional patterns that experienced developers would recognize, and how simple and direct the path from input to output is presented. Consider whether the code uses deep nesting or early returns, if error conditions are handled predictably and consistently, whether loops and conditionals are immediately comprehensible, and whether the code is organized in a way that makes the sequence of operations obvious.
