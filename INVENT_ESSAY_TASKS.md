## Task 1: Understand and Capture the Specific Request
The function must carefully listen to and accurately document exactly what the user is asking for—including the specific details, preferences, constraints, and criteria for success. This means going beyond surface-level understanding to grasp the intent, context, and nuance of the request. By thoroughly understanding what is actually being asked for, the function ensures that the final work meets the precise requirements rather than being based on assumptions. This task directly supports the Precision quality by creating a clear, detailed foundation that the work will be measured against.

## Task 2: Deliver Pragmatic Solutions Within Real Constraints
The function must assess the available resources, time, and practical limitations of the situation, then make intelligent decisions about the best approach to deliver a working, useful solution. This means recognizing trade-offs, adapting when perfect solutions aren't feasible, and focusing effort on what truly matters to solve the actual problem. Rather than pursuing an idealized approach that may be impossible or inefficient, the function chooses the path that delivers genuine value in the real world. This task directly supports the Pragmatism quality by ensuring the work is actually completed and genuinely useful, not just theoretically sound.
